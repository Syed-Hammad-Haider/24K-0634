//Create a class called LoanHelper, which helps the user calculate their loan payments. The class
//should have a variable that stores interest rate for the loan as a user defined constant value. Aside
//from the that, it also stores the amount for the loan taken and amount of months that the user will
//repay the loan in. The loan repayment should be calculated on a monthly basis, and the interest rate
//should be applied over the monthly return amount. The output should be something like:
//“You have to pay 999 every month for 12 monthsto repay your loan”
//Note: first divide loan amount by number of months, then apply the interest rate on it. Interest rate
//should be a value between 0-0.5%
