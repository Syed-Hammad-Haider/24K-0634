/* You are building a student management system. Create a class `Student` to manage student records.
Requirements:
1. Attributes:
    --> `studentID` (int)
    --> `name` (string)
    --> `age` (int)
    --> `grade` (char)
2. Define a default constructor that initializes `grade` to `'N'` (Not Assigned).
3. Define a parameterized constructor to initialize all attributes.
4. Add methods:
    --> `promoteStudent()`: Upgrades the student's grade (e.g., from 'A' to 'B').
    --> `isEligibleForScholarship()`: Returns `true` if the student's grade is 'A'.
    --> `displayDetails()`: Displays the student's details.
5. Create a few `Student` objects and test the methods. */
