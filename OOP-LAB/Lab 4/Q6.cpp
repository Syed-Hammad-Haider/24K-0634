/* Scenario: A bank wants to develop a system for managing customer accounts. The system should allow customers to:
1. Create a new account with an account number, owner’s name, and initial balance
(default balance is 0 if not provided).
2. Deposit money into their account.
3. Withdraw money from their account, ensuring they cannot withdraw more than the
available balance.
4. Display account details including account number, owner’s name, and current balance.
Your task is to implement a C++ program that fulfills these requirements. */
