/* Q3. You want to create a combined book by merging the contents of two chapters.
Requirements:
1. Assume two existing files: chapter1.txt and chapter2.txt. Populate them with some
text before running this.
2. Open chapter1.txt and chapter2.txt using ifstream in read mode.
3. Open book.txt using ofstream in ios::app mode.
4. Read from both files and append the contents sequentially to book.txt.
5. Ensure a newline is added between chapter contents.
6. After writing, open and display book.txt contents to verify concatenation. */
