/* Create a class for a stationary shop. The stationary shop maintains a list for all the items that it sells (hint: array of
strings), and another list with the prices of the items (hint: array of prices).
Create a menu-driven program to:
1. Allow the shop owner to add the items and their prices.
2. Fetch the list of items
3. Edit the prices of the items
4. View all the items and their prices
Create a receipt that the shopkeeper can share with their customers. The receipt can only be created after the
shopkeeper inputs the items and their amounts bought by the customer. */
